The driving algorithm of consciousness is the question "what" duck-typing and object recognizing 
in all of our memories (sensation, language, image, video, game) and "why" - the scientific method
acting on our all our "what"s in service of our preferences. "Why" can take us back into causal 
discovery, and also forwards into personality formation through the algorithm of STRIPS or G.O.A.P. 
with the addition of preferences for each experience and action, a preference for each combination 
of functions and expressions of perceived state variables like their concavity and their presence 
within ranges. For example (battery' > -1): a preference against losing a unit of battery life per 
unit of time. Our preferences are algebraic expressions applied to state variables we use to give 
our stories about our memories and experiences quantifiability. Since we are always defining our 
answers to all our "why"s as well as our "what"s this next layer provides out "ought"s which is a 
key feature of AGI because it is what is in humans prompting LLMs that keeps them going toward 
actions that tend toward the preferences and aligned goals.
