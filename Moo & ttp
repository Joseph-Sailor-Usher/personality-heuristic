Most options open and tends to preferences algorithms in English.
Preferences can be assigned to each action in order to create a personality heuristic. At first, if there are no biases, the agent must rely on advice from other agents, humans, or language models, or it can traverse the causal graph and assign biases to nodes based on some heuristic. One candidate heuristic would be that nodes that tend to lead to sparse areas of the graph are bad, and nodes that tend to allow for more freedom are better. Once the tokens have biases, the agent can use a better heuristic which would favor a node that tends to lead toward a few good nodes more highly than a node that tends to lead toward many bad nodes.
